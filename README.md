# Advent of code

_Advent of code_ is an annual event, where programmers (who don't know anything better to do with their life) can
compete in daily challenges for 24 days.

Even if not competing against friends or rivals, one can see it as great training because the challenges always include
algorithms which might come in handy one day. The daily challenges start relatively easy and get harder every day.  

What makes _Advent of code_ just awesome are the neat little stories around it.

If you want to solve it for yourself, go to [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## My solutions

Starting from the year 2021, I wanted to upload my solutions to a dedicated github-repository. It's the repository you
are looking at right now.

The structure of this repository includes one new source folder each year. In these folders, you can find more folders:
For each day I solved one of the puzzles you can find one more folder named `dayX` with `X` ranging between `1` and
`24`, the days for the calendar.  
If I solved in multiple programming languages (shouldn't happen usually, don't worry ^^), each language got its
dedicated folder.  
My personal dataset for a day is always in the root folder of each day.

And now, before you just copy my solutions, I highly encourage you to try solving the challenges yourself!
