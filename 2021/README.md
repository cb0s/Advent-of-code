# 2021

I just wanted to let you know that I plan to program all of my solutions in python. They are tested in an Anaconda
environment with Python 3.10 support.

As (as of now) all projects have a similar structure, I built a template, you can find in `raw_structure.py.template`.
Although I could have written a library, I thought it might be better like this to keep me the possibility to always
show the script as it is to friends.
